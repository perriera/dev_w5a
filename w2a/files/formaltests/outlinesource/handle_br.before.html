      In development you run your server.ts code directly using node as such:

   <div class="cc">
      I think you will find that Angular 2 does most of what you need to do for any given HTML/CSS application and does it nicely. However, there are occasions when doing things the old fashioned way is simpler and in some cases the only option. FreeFormJS's ng-external custom attribute gives you this flexibility out of the box!

; w0a: WebflowArchive INI format
;
; The w0a package focuses on simply extracting the contents of a 
; Webflow archive into a target directory. Typically the public 
; directory where the web server is serving HTML pages. 
;
; w0a does not concern itself with Angular 1 or Angular 2 formatting
; issues, it merely performs an extraction (aka. an unzip) of the 
; source file specified below into the destination directory
; specified below, where is, as is. 
;
; w0a however also implements the basic requirements of the 
; running the utility in watchMode as well as the reading of 
; parameters plus any other basic duties required of a standard
; CLI based framework. Thereby setting up a foundation for other
; frameworks such as w1a and w2a.
